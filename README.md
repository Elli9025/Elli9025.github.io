Personal Website (Web Dev)
This was my first project in Web Dev and is a personal portfolio site I created with pure HTML and CSS. I was inspired by designs I found online and this was a very good introduction to web development. This project served as an excellent base for learning more web development skills and helped me land an internship in the following spring after I added a link to it in my resume.
